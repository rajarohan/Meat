# Meat Freshness Prediction App 🥩

A smart Android application that detects the freshness of meat using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The app analyzes meat images to predict freshness and estimates the time elapsed since the meat was cut, providing an innovative solution for ensuring meat quality.

---

## 📖 Features

- **Freshness Detection**: Predicts the freshness of meat using advanced image analysis.
- **Time Estimation**: Estimates how long it has been since the meat was cut.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use Android application.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Results in seconds after capturing or uploading an image.
- **CNN-Based Model**: Accurate predictions using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Android Studio**: Development platform.
- **Python**: For training the CNN model.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep Learning framework.
- **OpenCV**: Image preprocessing and enhancement.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- A custom dataset of meat images labeled with time elapsed since cutting.
- Images were preprocessed using techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Capture or Upload**: Take a picture of the meat or upload an existing image.
2. **Image Preprocessing**: The app preprocesses the image for better analysis.
3. **CNN Prediction**: The trained model predicts the freshness level.
4. **Result Display**: The app shows:
   - Time Since Cutting (in hours)
